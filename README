DNA assembly is now a challenge because of the
 overwhelming amount of data produced by sequencing
 facilities. De Novo Assembler is an assembler
 to perform De Novo assembly with new sequencing 
technologies (i.g. Titanium).


Also to ensure that nothing goes wrong, you should limit the memory usage.

1. quality analysis, choose minimum coverage
2. build graph without annotations
3. find connected parts
4. for each of them
	quality analysis
	build graph, with annotations
	assemble graph
	merge contigs
	assemble contigs
	merge meta-contigs

assemble meta-contigs
merge meta-contigs

1. scaffolding

An example of commands:

dna_DeBruijnAssembler -assemblyDirectory test file1.fasta fileA.fasta file3.fastq file4.sff 
cd test
dna_Merger Contigs.fa fasta.contigs 
tarchive2amos -s fasta.contigs -o amos
