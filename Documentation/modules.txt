DNA.rb is the main script.

It calls these modules:


dna_BuildGraph         
dna_ExtractContigs
dna_KeepLargeContigs   
dna_MergeContigs
dna_JoinContigs        

These modules are  not built-in  DNA.rb, but  they are necessary to scaffold
contigs

dna_ConvertSffToFasta  
dna_ScaffoldContigs

Using DNA.rb is very easy. You  basically just  write DNA.rb followed by a
list of  files, which can be encoded in fasta, fastq, or sff.



454 example:

DNA.rb file.sff


Solexa example:

DNA.rb file.fastq


Sanger example:

DNA.rb file.fasta


Mixed example:

DNA.rb file.sff file.fastq file.fasta
