DNA assembly is now a challenge because of the
 overwhelming amount of data produced by sequencing
 facilities. 454 De Novo Assembler is an assembler
 to perform De Novo assembly with new sequencing 
technologies (i.g. Titanium).

It takes fastq files and generate an assembly 
(see http://blog.malde.org/index.php/2008/11/14/454-sequencing-and-parsing-the-sff-binary-format for converting sff to fastq).
 In theory, 454 De Novo Assembler can assemble reads from any 
technology as long as the quality is provided 
(see http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/FASTQ_sequence_format for the format). 
The algorithm contructs De Bruijn graphs 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph).

example:
