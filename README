DNA assembly is now a challenge because of the
 overwhelming amount of data produced by sequencing
 facilities. De Novo Assembler is an assembler
 to perform De Novo assembly with new sequencing 
technologies (i.g. Titanium).


Also to ensure that nothing goes wrong, you should limit the memory usage.


ulimit -v  230000000 # in kB



Using DNA is easy.
